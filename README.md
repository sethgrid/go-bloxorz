# Go Bloxorz

Inspired by an article I cought on the golang sub-reddit (http://blog.ackx.net/tripping-on-go-bloxorz.html), this is a start of a terminal implementation of Bloxorz (http://www.coolmath-games.com/0-bloxorz/) in Go.

The article set out to make a solver and that sounded fun. Before I actually read the article, I wanted to give it a whirl. Step 1, make the game (done*). Step 2, create a solver.

[*] The game does not yet support switches or transports or anything fancy. Just solid cells, empty cells, the goal, and the bloxorz block.

## To Play
Clone the repo, go install bloxorz, and run main.go.

VERSION: "0.1.0"
